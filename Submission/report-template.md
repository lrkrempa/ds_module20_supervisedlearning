## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis was to use different techniques to test a model based on loan risk and to see how accurately this machine learning model can define a healthy loan or a high risk loan. The main machine learning model used was Logistic Regression. The confustion matrix and the classification report were also used to assess the results of the Logistic Regression model.

## Results

* Machine Learning Model 1: Logistic Regression
    * Accuracy: 0.99
    * Precision: 1.00 ('0'), 0.87 ('1')
    * Recall: 1.00 ('0'), 0.89 ('1")

## Summary

The Logistic Regression model performs the best when predicting healthy loans, which is shown by a precision and recall score of both 1.00. Although it does not predict high risk loans as well, it still shows a solid performance due to a precision score of 0.87 and a recall score of 0.89. Overall, I would recommend the model for predicting loans, especially healthy loans.
